Hi YC!

This is a cleaned and simplified version of the pipeline that would be used in MimicMol. There is also a flowchart of what is going on in the repo as well. 

To use this code, you would need to input an OpenAI API key (or similar). I left mine out for privacy reasons.

Below is the result of one of the unit tests we conducted (for CBL-2) when evaluating this pipeline, of which there is more detail in the written application. I've also added both starting datasets, which were downloaded from ChemBL. 


|---------|--------|
| Number of Generated Molecules | 10000 | 
| Number of Generated Molecules, filtered for structural feasibility | 9002  | 

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Data 4   | Data 5   | Data 6   |
| Data 7   | Data 8   | Data 9   |

Let me know if you have any questions!
